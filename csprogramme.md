1 Winter Semester
-----------------

 1. Introduction to Computer Science: TODO: is this too much/too little?
  - Boolean logic
  - Bits/Bytes conversions etc
  - binary, hex, oct, xor, and, or
  - Brief History: where we were, where we are now
      + This is also important. I would like the student to get a grasp of the scale.
  - Super important: What fields exist in computer science. A computer scientist must know before hand and at least have an idea 
    on what field they can follow during their studies and what studying in this field means. 
      + Networks
      + Computer Architecture
      + Machine learning / Data Science
      + AI / Robotics
      + Systems & Security
      + Software Engineering
      + Web / Mobile Development
      + Extreme Computing / Distributed Systems
      + Video games / Graphics

  2. Programming Foundations
   - This will be the first programming course of the students using the python language. TODO: decide python2.7 or python3
   - foundations of programming: variable naming, operators, syntax etc
   - foundations of structured programming: if/elif/else, while/for/do, functions
   - python basics: lists, directories, tuples
   - more python:
   - compiled vs interpreted/scripts vs vm'ed languages: give examples of each and compare with python now that they can program a       bit. Almost every student will have heard of more languages. Let them understand why different languages exist and what their           differences are. Obviously not in depth. The first semester is about broadening the views of the students. 
   
 3. Introduction to Algorithms & Data structures
   - Start with some simple algorithms and their brute force solutions
   - THEN learn about complexity
   - then revisit and lower complexity
   - basic algorithmic thinking must be developed in this course
   - TODO: some more thought needed
  
  
  
  Courses to be picked (just a scrap list to add to when somthing pops in mind)
  --------------------------
  - Mathematics for Computer Science: things like discrete mathematics, probabilities, etc TODO: add more to this
  
  - Introduction to security: Thinking of having this in the second semester. All students must have some core security knowledge.           Simple things like SSL, cryptography, how bugs can be vulnerabilities etc
