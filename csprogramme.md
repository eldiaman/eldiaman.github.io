1 Winter Semester
-----------------

 1 Introduction to Computer Science:
  - Basic algorithms using pseudocode
  - Boolean logic
  - Bits/Bytes conversions etc
  - Brief History: where we were, where we are now
    + This is also important. I would like the student to get a grasp of the scale.
  - Super important: What fields exist in computer science. A computer scientist must know before hand and at least have an idea 
    on what field they can follow during their studies and what studying in this field means. 
      + Networks
      + Computer Architecture
      + Machine learning / Data Science
      + AI / Robotics
      + Systems & Security
      + Software Engineering
      + Web / Mobile Development
      + Extreme Computing / Distributed Systems
      + Video games / Graphics
